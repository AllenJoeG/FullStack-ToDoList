# Project Name
  - The Protean Sisyphean - A CRUDdy way to keep track of your life.

## Duration
  Weekend assignment. Development window <48 hours

## Description
  - This assignment entailed creating a Full-Stack, locally hosted application that functions as a To-Do list. In its current state it is also a first-pass implementation of Bootstrap.
  - User can add a Task name, due date, and two boxes for storing details/notes. The DB also tracks completion status and current progress.
  - Structured to build out further implementation: Progress from Boolean to multi-stage. Multiple fields to support further edit/update functionality.
  - Currently the PUT route only accepts marking a task 'complete'
  - There are some code artifacts currently commented out from before/after Bootstrap implementation.
